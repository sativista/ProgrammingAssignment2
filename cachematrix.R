## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## In this function we intend to make cacheable matrix 
## and to calc it inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)

}


## Here is where the magic happens
## Because of the lexical scoping we can reach the matrix 
## in the inveronment that it was defined, and it is usefull 
## if we know how to use it.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
